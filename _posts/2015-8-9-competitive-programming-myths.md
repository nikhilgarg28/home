I get a lot of emails about competitive programming, mostly from the
beginners who are self-proclaimed mediocre programmers and want to get a job at
their dream company. The volume of such messages has increased so much that I
can not reply to them any more. 

To save myself some pain, I am going to share some tips about improving in
competitive programming. But before I do that, I want to expand on [my Quora
answer](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-misconceptions-made-in-the-world-of-competitive-programming/answer/Nikhil-Garg) 
to bust away some common myths about competitive programming and share some bad
reasons to start pouring all the free time in writing short programs to toy
problems.

Myth: Success in programming competitions is a perfect estimator of success in software engineering.
---

While some people who do well in programming competitions also do well in
software engineering, there are plenty of people who are good only in one of
competitive programming and software engineering. I have written a [Quora
answer](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-software-development-and-competitive-programming/answer/Nikhil-Garg)
 about some big differences between the two. [Peter Norvig has even 
claimed that the programming competitions correlate negatively with being good 
on the job.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdmyUZCl75s)

I don't go that far but I do believe that beyond a point, competitive programming 
is a full sport in its own right and becoming further better at it doesn't necessarily 
make one better at software engineering. It's like wrestling and strength are 
related but beyond a certain point, wrestling is so much more about techniques 
specific to wrestling. The best wrestler in the world is not the stronger person
in the world.

So don't do competitive programming to become a better software engineer. You
might be better off working on a larger codebase with multiple people.


Myth: Success in programming competitions is a perfect estimator for smartness.
---

Now this is a big one. A lot of people who do extremely well in competitive
programming are smart for sure. I also believe that people who are smart will
have some natural edge over others. But practice and technique plays a very big
role - much bigger than most people are ready to believe. Some of the smartest
people could totally suck at them, if they don't practice. Similarly, not so
smart people, by their shear hard work and dedication can slowly reach the top. 

Tangentially, I believe that hard work and dedication eat smartness
for lunch in every other area of life as well. I'm not making it up 
[research shows that grit is the best predictor of the long term success.](
http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit?language=en)
 shows that grit is the best predictor of the long term success. Silicon
Valley has very well embraced this idea. People and companies toil for years
through highs and lows before seeing a penny of revenue. 

Either way, my point is - if you don't do well in programming competitions,
don't lose your heart. Don't take it to mean that you're not smart. Continue
working hard and stay dedicated and it will take you places.


Myth: Success in competitive programming is a ladder to an engineering job at one of your dream companies like Google/Facebook or Quora.
---

Many companies ask algorithmic problems in their interviews and that does
provide a slight edge to competitive programmers. But here are some caveats:

* Many interviewers are aware of this and try to normalize interviewee's
performance by their experience. For example, I've heard people say things
like - "He did bad for someone who has been doing competitive programming
for 3 years."

* If you don't come from a strong/reputed CS program and if you've spent
most of your college time doing only competitive programming, there is a chance
that your resume won't even be screened for interviews. 

* Some interviews (but not all) evaluate architecture and system design
skills as well. Not knowing about system design because you've spent all
your time doing competitive programming will hurt you in the end!

I'm going to write a detailed post in the future about what you should do to 
best prepare yourself for a job at your dream company in the Silicon Valley but 
till then, just remember that competitive programming isn't necessarily your best
means to get your dream job.

Myth: Top rated programmers are filthy rich.
---

And finally, some people start doing competitive programming because they think
that the top rated programmers make a lot of money in the competitions. I think
it's just the worst reason to start doing competitive programming - the money is
too little and is distributed only among the very best competitive programmers.
I'm sure that there are very many different and better ways for you to monetize
the thousands of hours you will have to put into competitive programming.

To not sound too demotivating, I want to end this post by sharing my
personal experience with competitive programming. I thoroughly enjoyed
participating in many competitions and I learnt a hell lot. Representing India
in the world finals of ACM ICPC twice is still one of the proudest experience 
of my life. Knowing what I know, if I have to do it all over again, I'd still 
do a lot of competitive programming.

So I'm not trying to say that competitive programming is bad - I just hope you
don't start doing it for some wrong reasons.

Good luck!
