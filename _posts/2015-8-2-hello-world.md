My name is [Nikhil Garg](/about) and this is my home page. Thanks for visiting.
How is it going?

I spend a lot of time thinking about technology, programming, systems, 
products, internet, world etc.  I've also collected a bunch of lessons 
as an engineer and an engineering manager which I think could be useful to 
others as well. I am going to write about all that in the form of essays here. 
These essays should be be useful to you if:

* You are a beginner at programming.
* You are a professional software engineer.
* You are an engineer and are considering moving to management.
* You are an engineering manager.
* You are interested in following trends in technology/industry.
* You like to speculate (and read others' speculation) of how our world is
 evolving.


Please feel free to [contact](/contact) me if you would like me to write about something specific.
