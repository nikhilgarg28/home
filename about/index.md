My name is Nikhl Garg and I am an engineering manager at a startup called Quora.
I lead a team of great engineers working on Quora's core product features and
the quality of the user content. I am very interested in distributed systems,
product design and user experience, new programming languages and paradigms,
and machine learning. 

When I'm not thinking about technology, I am thinking
about organization - managing a team of great individuals, creating the best
culture for innovation and setting up the right systems/processes. 

I also enjoy thinking about the future of technology, programming and even our
world and try to model everything in life as a large distributed system of
independent agents following a system of incentives.

Biography
---------

I grew up in the small city of Bhiwani in Haryana, India, famous for its temples
and professional boxers. After finishing my high school in Bhiwani, I went to IIT
Delhi for the second phase of my life where I studied Computer Science, fell in 
love with the abstract world of mathematics, did a lot of competetitve programming 
and made a lot of great friends.

The third phase of my life began shortly thereafter when I came to Silicon
Valley in the US and started working at Quora as a software engineer. I
thouroughly enjoyed building things and worked on core infrastructure to 
building user-facing products and everything in-between. 

The fourth phase of my life began when I managed to convinced my best friend
Harsha to marry me. I'm still learning to balance being a son, a husband, an 
engineer and an engineering manager.
